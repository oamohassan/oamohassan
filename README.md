### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building projects to show my skills within data science. See them on my profile!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently developing my data engineering skills. While I have a broad basic knowledge of **SQL, python, excel, and so forth**, I want to push into **post-intermediate and advanced** skill levels! First up: becoming advanced in SQL.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a teacher, so whenever I learn anything, I frame it in my head as if I'm going to teach it to someone else and I need to know how to explain it in a simple, basic way. 
ETLI5 is my specialty!
